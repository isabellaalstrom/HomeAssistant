# My Home Assistant configuration

[HASS.io](https://home-assistant.io/) on a Inte NUC.

Feel free to ask me about anything

My Lovelace config is inspired from [Homekit Inspired Lovelace By Jimz011](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/homekit-inspired-lovelace-by-jimz011-v0-1b-august-2019-ha-0-97-x-compatible/117086). A lot of the code in my setup is from Jimz

Screenshots from my lovelace can be found [in /screenshots](https://github.com/Nicxe/HomeAssistant/tree/master/screenshots)
